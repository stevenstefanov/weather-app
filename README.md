## Background

I love riding my bike and playing sports outdoors but I really do not like the rain. I also have sensitive skin. This application will help me know what they weather and will also provide me with a UV indicator.

## Challenges

It was pretty challenging defining all the individual pieces of data for the weather cards such as the wind speed, the UV lighting, etc. It was also challenging to modify the DOM a lot through JavaScript.

## Learnings

I learned so much more about how to manipulate the DOM, how to use server APIs and how to write functions in JavaScript.

## Usage

When the site loads, type in the name of a city in the search bar and press the search button. The user will be presented with detailed current weather information and a 5-day temperature and humidity forecast. Recent searches will get saved on the left side as buttons.

## Credits

Thank you to Columbia's Full-Stack Web Developer bootcamp for all the assistance and for teaching me all that I have learned.
